# Automatic-Colorization-using-Neural-Network

## Overview

This project aims to automatically add color to grayscale images using neural networks. Leveraging deep learning techniques, our system learns to predict the most plausible colors for each pixel in a grayscale image, thereby transforming it into a vibrant, colored version. This README provides an overview of the project, its functionalities, and instructions for usage.

## Features

- **Grayscale to Color Transformation**: Converts grayscale images to colored images automatically.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a neural network architecture trained on a dataset of grayscale and colored image pairs.
- **Customization**: Users can tweak parameters and settings for different colorization effects.
- **Efficiency**: Fast processing times, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (version X.X.X)
- NumPy
- OpenCV

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shashikala1828/autocolorization.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Dataset

The performance of the colorization model heavily relies on the quality and diversity of the dataset used for training. It's essential to have a dataset consisting of pairs of grayscale images and their corresponding colored versions. If you're interested in training your own model or contributing to the project, you can use the following sources to gather datasets:
